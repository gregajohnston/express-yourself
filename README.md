# Text Miner

## Introduction

This program utilizes regular expressions to parse data and extract it into common forms, such as telephone numbers or area codes.

## File Structure

Text Miner is a Python package, designed to be used with a Python shell. The main directory is *text-miner*, which contains two subfolders, *textminer* and *tests*. The *textminer* folder contains the programs necessary for performing any data transformations. The *test* subfolder is for debugging purposes only and should not be used for any data mining.

## Installation

This is a stand-alone program that requires no installation. All interaction with the program is done through a terminal. Simply call the functions as needed using a Python shell and pass information as arguments.

## Requirements

The textminer program requires the re modules, which they import at runtime. The test program requires pytest, but should not be necessary for most applications.
